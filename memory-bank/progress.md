# Progress: Crowdin CLI Standalone

## What Works

- Project structure created
- AWT stripper implemented
- GraalVM reflection feature implemented
- Test project created
- GitHub workflow for building and releasing Crowdin CLI binaries implemented
- Matrix strategy for building on different platforms implemented
- Version checking logic implemented
- GitHub release creation implemented

## What's Left to Build

1. **Repository Setup**
   - [x] Create directory structure
   - [x] Copy necessary files
   - [x] Update workflow files
   - [x] Create documentation
   - [ ] Create repository on GitHub
   - [ ] Push files to repository
   - [ ] Set up secrets and variables

2. **Workflow Testing**
   - [ ] Trigger workflow manually
   - [ ] Verify binary building
   - [ ] Verify GitHub release creation
   - [ ] Test on different platforms

3. **Setup Action Integration**
   - [x] Update setup action to use new repository
   - [ ] Test setup action with new repository
   - [ ] Verify that binaries are downloaded correctly

## Current Status

The project has been prepared for migration to a separate repository. We've created a clean directory structure, copied all necessary files, updated the workflow files to use the new repository, and created comprehensive documentation.

Key improvements include:
- Removing the "executable-" prefix from release tags for simplicity
- Updating the repository references in the workflow files
- Creating a README.md file for the new repository
- Creating a LICENSE file for the new repository
- Creating a .gitignore file for the new repository
- Creating a .gitattributes file for the new repository

The next steps are to create a new repository on GitHub, push the files to the repository, set up the necessary secrets and variables, and test the workflow.

## Known Issues

- The workflow has not been tested with the new repository yet
- The setup action has not been tested with the new repository yet
